Coming Soon

## __Original__
The original version by **Pok-Ching Lee** originally found at http://kquest.pokw.com/knightq.html

## __Edited__
Edited version by **ichrisi** adding **better experience and god mode** found at http://ichrisi.bizhat.com/KQuest%20(Edited)/knightq.html

I could not find the dead.html page for the edited version and could not find the image for that page for either version so it remains broken for now.

## __Rewrite__
This version is my attempt to rewrite the game using modern coding standards making it more readable and upgradable as well as a restyle for modern devices and user expecations of website styles.
